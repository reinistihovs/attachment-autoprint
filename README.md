# attachment-autoprint
This powershell script fetches picture and pdf attachments from IMAP account and silently prints them automatically to the default printer.
you can run print.ps1 with powershell manually or create a scheduled task, which executes C:\attachment-print\task.vbs
I have tested many ways to hide the running task, and had best results with vbs.
